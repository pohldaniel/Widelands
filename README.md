# Widelands 1.1

This repository contains a Visual Studio 2015 setup of https://github.com/widelands/widelands and it's dependencies. I had to do small tweaks to the code by using VS 2015 and highly recomand using a newer version. Unfortunataly I wasn't able to split up the libwidelands project into smaller libraries but will try it again soon. After compiling the directory widelands/data had to copied manually aside of the executable. Don't go with the Debug build It should be clear that the Copyright of Warmux and of it's dependencies are not in my hand.

My intention for this repository is to get a deeper understanding of game programing.
